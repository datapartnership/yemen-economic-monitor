# Support for Monitoring the State of the Yemen Economy

The Yemen Macroeconomics, Trade and Investment team is responsible for undertaking macroeconomic surveillance of Yemen and conducting analytical studies to guide economic policy and development. However, published data can be delayed or unreliable, making traditional macroeconomic monitoring a challenge.  

Over time, datasets, code, and documentation will be added to the repository, supporting reproducibility and reusability of all work conducted in support of the monitoring work.
